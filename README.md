 # Python Logic Building Problems with Physics Context
 
This repository contains beginner-friendly Python programs designed to strengthen logic through real-world physics problems. Each program uses a physics formula, takes user input, 

and prints results with proper units. The focus is on clarity and learning, making it useful for students, educators, and peer reviewers.

##        Problem Overview
