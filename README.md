 # Python Logic Building Problems with Physics Context
This repository contains beginner-friendly Python programs designed to strengthen logic through real-world physics problems. Each program uses a physics formula, takes user input, 

and prints results with proper units. The focus is on clarity and learning, making it useful for students, educators, and peer reviewers.

 ## Problem Overview


|  | **Topic** | **Formula** | **Output** |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Distance using Speed & Time | Distance $ = \text{Speed}  \times \text{Time}$ | Distance (m) |
| **2** | Force using Newton’s Second Law | Force $ = \text{Mass} \times \text{Acceleration}$ | Force (N) |
| **3** | Gravitational Potential Energy | $PE = mgh$ | Energy (J) |
| **4** | Kinetic Energy | $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$ | Energy (J) |
| **5** | Voltage using Ohm’s Law | $V = IR$ | Voltage (V) |
| **6** | Projectile Maximum Height | $h = \frac{v^2 \sin^2\theta}{2g}$ | Height (m) |
| **7** | Spring Oscillator Period | $T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}$ | Period (s) |
| **8** | Free Fall Time | $t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}}$ | Time (s) |
| **9** | Work Done by Force | $W = Fd \cos\theta$ | Work (J) |
| **10** | Power Consumption | $P = \frac{W}{t}$ | Power (W) |
